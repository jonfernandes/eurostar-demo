    <h1>INC0006057 WEB_0 error when recalling an old booking via MYB CLOSED</h1>
    <div>Results Received : a message that does not make sense<br><br>Results Expected : for a sensible message to show, such as - unable to retrieve bookings more than 2 months past the travel date.<br><br>Advised : provided info in a different way<br><br>The Effect : pax comment - Incidentally, feeding this reference into &quot;Manage my booking&quot; produces an incomprehensible compute error message.<br>Even if the information is not intended to be available by this route, a much more customer-friendly message would be helpful! Regards.Â </div>
