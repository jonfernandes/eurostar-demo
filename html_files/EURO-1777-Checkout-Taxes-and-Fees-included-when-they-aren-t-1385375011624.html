    <h1>EURO-1777 [Checkout] Taxes and Fees included when they aren't</h1>
    <div>We need to change the Checkout page verbatim to reflect the fact that it states Taxes and Fees included but it shows City Tax which is not included. (see screenshot) 1 suggestion would be to change the wording to Municipality Fee: X,XXâ‚¬ City Tax (Not included in total trip cost, payable at hotel)</div>
