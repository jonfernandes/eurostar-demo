    <h1>INC14665 Connections - SST issues when outward part of bkg has been issued in UK.</h1>
    <div>I have received a reply from Distribution as to why this occurred: This is because we changed Amsterdam to having E-Tickets following an issue last week. We can switch it off again if it is desired but note the following. We turned it on because someone wanted to print@home Thalys tickets from AMS-PAR however if we turn off then it will not be possible to use print@home on any Amsterdam tickets. If we leave it on then they can issue these tickets via Print@home but the scenario you describe may also occur. We can possible look at fare types and controlling it that way but do we still want to block print@home. Answer given to L Nistor and she would like log left open for further dicussion Please find below more information regarding dates on the transition from KALM to Thalys Through Fares: KALM as a product will cease to exist on the 26th of July 2012 offline. Offline sales of Thalys through fares will start on the 26th of June to travel from 27th of July 2012 Any Dutch Station product is available to be sold online since Wednesday 23rd of May. More detailed communication regarding Thalys through fares to front line staff will be organised before the product goes live. In the meantime if you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact Loredana or Anne. I will suspend this log untill the 26.6.12 and this issue can be retested then Kind Regards Samantha M Cox International Rail Product Specialist for the Distribution Helpdesk Eurostar International Dear all, This issue will remain open as it affects connections booking and not just KALM, so I will re-name it to the following: RB 555315 Connections - SST issues when outward part of bkg has been issued in UK. Loredana / Rita, Please keep us updated on this issue. Thanks Claire CHASED THE C</div>
