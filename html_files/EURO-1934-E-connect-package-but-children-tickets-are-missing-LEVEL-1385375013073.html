VSCT has confirmed that they are working on a resolution in a new eConnect release. The plan is to have the new version loaded on the test platform for us to test around the last week of August. Depending on the results we are looking at a release in September. I’m sorry I don’t have any firm dates yet but this is definitely a step forward.
