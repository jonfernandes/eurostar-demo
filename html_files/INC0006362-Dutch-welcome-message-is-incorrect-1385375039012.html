    <div>Steps Taken :<br>Remove your cookies Go to <a href="http://Eurostar.com" target="_blank">Eurostar.com</a><br><br>Results Received : The message for Dutch speaking people makes absolutely no sense and has spelling mistakes too. It now says: “If you live in Belgium and you speak Dutch, click below” whereas it should be: “Please select your country of residence below” as it says in English and in French. </div>
