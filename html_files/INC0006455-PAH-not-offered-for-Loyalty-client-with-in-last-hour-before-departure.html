    <h1>INC0006455 PAH not offered for Loyalty client with in last hour before departure</h1>
    <div><div>
	Scenario:</div>
<div>
	1 ) EFT redemption booking made on dotcom done at 14.09 :</div>
<div>
	         - Train departing within the hour (i.e. 14.52).</div>
<div>
	         - Train departing from London (to Paris)</div>
<div>
	2) the print at home link not available at the end of the booking and on the after sale section</div>
<div>
	 </div>
<div>
	Note this is also happening for the French agencies who try to retrieve their print a home on the website using Manage your booking</div>
<div>
	 </div>
<div>
	STEPS TO REPRODUCE:</div>
<div>
	 </div>
<div>
	Book a one way from London - Paris (for instance) and then try to issue the print at home less then 1 h before departure. </div>
<div>
	 </div>
<div>
	Expected result: It should work.</div>
<div>
	 </div>
<div>
	I would recommend you make a booking with no 48h PAH restriction (such as a booking with an EFT member or booked with EFT points).</div>
<div>
	 </div>
<div>
	PLEASE REMEMBER .. IT DOESNT MATTER WHEN THE BOOKING IS MADE .. IT MATTERS THAT THE PAH NEEDS TO BE SEEN RIGHT UP TO DEPARTURE .<br>	<br>	<strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"> NO MORE EXAMPLES NEEDED </strong></div></div>
