    <div>Issue customer received INC0005221 Error&quot; Threed callback&quot; received in a failed booking : Client charged. WEB_011 FIXED 20.8.13 CLOSED We dont know what the error means re DSS but a Thred in Computor terms is a sequence of programmed instructions .( cor sitting with IS is really rubbing offf on me !) And it seems in this case that the instruction call for the thread (correct spelling ,DSS programmers! ) or programmed instruction at that point-of-booking failed and in the example given it was at payment stage NO MORE EXAMPLES NEEDED 4 example provided and Payment systems know where the issue lies and are creating a fix asap WORKAROUND If no payment taken/booking made Book offline What to do next 1. Click&quot; Is this the problem your customer faced?&quot; 2. Log on call logger as DSS bug 3. Report issue on bug form including the above information</div>
