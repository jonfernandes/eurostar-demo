    <h1>I0060 - GDS Error Management Strategy – Reissues & Revalidation's</h1>
    <div>GDS Error Management Strategy - Reissues &amp; Revalidation&#39;s Distribution and the GDS Tech team are starting a project to find out the cause why Revalidation&#39;s and Re-issues tend to fail. This will involve the GDS team taking over calls from E4A in order to collect the relevant info for us to send on for further investigation. This will involve collecting Edifacts from Galileo and Sabre helpdesk&#39;s for Avancial to investigate. A spreadsheet has been set up in order to record all information including Hyper linked histories and Edifacts traces received. The Process 1. When E4A have a live example on the phone. The E4A advisor should investigate to see if any obvious detail is missing to see if the problem is user based as opposed to a technical error. 2. Once a technical error is established, the advisor should transfer the call to the GDS team in order to record the issue and save all histories to the booking, then speak to the necessary helpdesk to request the Edifacts traces for the GDS team to forward to Avancial for further investigation. Update 30/5 The process has changed slightly for Galileo bookings due to the need to capture live edifact messages. Initially the GDS team were to call Galileo with agents on the line and attempt the reval/re-issue, then we was requested to email the Galileo helpdesk and now we open an incident with travelport OSR and submit requests for edifact messages including a date stamp for when the reval/re-issue was attempted. Update 18/07 Investigation ongoing. Have obtained EDIFACTs from Sabre and Test system and working on obtaining them from Avancial as well. Working on mapping the transaction to keep as template. Cases still trickle in from on phone team. Summary below of actions taken Exchange failures (reissued) for GDS bookings Avancial log - ARS 527827 (open after the ARS 525836) Description of error - user unable to change semi-flexible fares on ex-continent routes <div style=""></div></div>
