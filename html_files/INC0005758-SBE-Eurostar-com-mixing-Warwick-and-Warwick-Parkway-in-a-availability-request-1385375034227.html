    <h1>INC0005758 SBE/Eurostar.com mixing Warwick and Warwick Parkway in a availability request.CLOSED</h1>
    <div>When Warwick or Warwick Parkway is selected in UK Interlining through EUROSTAR.COM, the SBE offers on some journeys the incorrect departure or origin station.<br>In the attached example, the request was from Warwick Parkway to Paris but the journey at 1442 was from Warwick.<br>If the journey is requested to/from Warwick, the UK origin/destination must always be Warwick and if the is requested to/from Warwick Parkway, the UK origin/destination must always be Warwick Parkway.<br><br>These two stations are completely separate so should not be mixed.Â </div>
