    <h1>NEWESTAR-2624 Passenger surname : Character added that wasn't applied by customer cause of error PHP_23000</h1>
    <div>PNR:TSPUAX<br>passenger name :Jenner<br>Emaill address: <a href="mailto:SALLY.JENNER@HOTMAIL.CO.UK" target="_blank">SALLY.JENNER@HOTMAIL.CO.UK</a><br><br>Steps Taken : There appears to be an &#39;A&#39; before William&#39;s surname (Jenner) which should not be there as it is not a middle initial and the customer is fairly certain that they did not entre &#39;A&#39; on his name.<br>None of the other passengers have this extra &#39;A&#39; in the name field. I have seen this before so I am inclined to believe that the customer did not make the error.<br><br>this was noticed as the client had an error at payment stage <br><div>
	PHP_23000 occuring on payment which advises the passenger that the payment has failed and no money has been taken yet the booking is valid for travel and the customer has paid in full.</div>
