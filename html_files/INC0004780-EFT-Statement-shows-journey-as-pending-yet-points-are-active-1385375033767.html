	<span style="color: #0000cd;">Hi Team, </span></div>
<div>
	 </div>
<div>
	<span style="color: #0000cd;">We have investigated this issue with the latest example provided by EDHD (EPP member 30838110005978830) and we were able to reproduce this issue. </span></div>
<div>
	 </div>
<div>
	<span style="color: #0000cd;">During our investigation, we got to know that the &lt;customerTransaction&gt; response which we are getting from iloyal in that, we are getting &lt;point type&gt; PNDPNT &lt;/pointType&gt; which indicates &quot;pending point&quot; . Because of this in the online statement the number of points is displayed in blue with the pending points hover text. </span></div>
<div>
	 </div>
<div>
	<span style="color: #0000cd;">This incident has been assigned to iLoyal development team for further investigation. </span></div>
