	Passenger went through their booking on the website and was quoted a price of €345.00. </div>
<div>
	This price also shows in out in house system and  their booking confirmation and through MYB . </div>
<div>
	The passenger then called us saying she had been charged €369.00 . My collegue checked datacash as €345.00 was showing on our in house systems and saw that the charge on Data cash was showing as €369.00. </div>
