    <h1>INC0006381 "Add Hotel and Save Money " incorrectly appears on the ROW and US sites CLOSED</h1>
    <div>I can see the option to &#39;Add a hotel and save money&#39; is made available on both US and ROW site.<br><br>On the ROW site, it takes the customer to the &#39;Oops We&#39;re sorry&#39; page, which is the original bug logged under DSS-3812.<br>On the US site, it takes the customer to the White Label where they can select their hotel.<br>This is very misleading as the customer has already entered the train details and now is asked to choose their hotel, they are led to believe that they are booking train + hotel and saving money</div>
