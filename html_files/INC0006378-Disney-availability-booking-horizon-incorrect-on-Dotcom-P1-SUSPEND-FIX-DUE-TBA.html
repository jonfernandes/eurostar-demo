    <h1>INC0006378 Disney availability booking horizon incorrect on Dotcom  P1 SUSPEND FIX DUE TBA</h1>
    <div>There has been an agreement to change the booking horizon for Disney on <a href="http://eurostar.com" target="_blank">eurostar.com</a> to 270days.<br>We are limited to this future booking window on dotcom (like for the Ski trains) and please be aware that this will still fall short of the offline (Elgar/ Opera ) one.<br>It needs to be tested and if all goes well there will be a GoLive date advisedr.<br><br>We will keep you informed in case of any changes . For now , please continue to make any Disney bookings for dates beyond what can be sold online , offline for the customer .<br><br><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>More examples needed?
